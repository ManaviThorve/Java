*The super Keyword*
-- Super keyword is used to resolve the ambiguity between the variables and method names same in sub and super class 
--It is also used to call the base class constructor
--It is used in Inheritance 
--When the constructor is called using super constructor the order of type of the actual and formal parameter should be same 
--When the super keyword is used to call the base class constructor the statement must be the first line within the constructor.
eg 
class base
{
	int b;
	base()
	{
	}
	void show()
	{
		sop(b);
	}
}
class derived
{
	int b;
	derived()
	{
		super();
	}
	void show()
	{
		super.show
		sop(super.b);
		sop(b);
	}
}
